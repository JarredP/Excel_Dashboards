Using Excel for data anlysis and visualization. This respository contains excel files where I have used built in data anlytic tools to clean and visualize data in Excel.
I have created interactive dashboards to display the visualizations in a user-friendly and effective way.
These files demonstate several skills such as use of xlookup, index and match, data cleaning, pivot tables, slicers, and dashboarding.
